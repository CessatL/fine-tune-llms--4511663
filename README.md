In this course, award-winning tech innovator and AI/ML leader Kesha Williams guides you through several concepts and techniques that you can use to fine-tune LLMs using your own data. Explore the concepts and costs of fine-tuning and learn how to set up your environment for it. Go over the steps to prepare your data and fine-tune a pre-trained LLM. Plus, practice evaluating and iterating a fine-tuned model. Practical, hands-on challenges in each chapter give you a chance to deepen your understanding of the topics.
