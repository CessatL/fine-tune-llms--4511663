# Fine-Tune Your LLMs
This is the repository for the LinkedIn Learning course `Fine-Tune Your LLMs`. The full course is available from [LinkedIn Learning][lil-course-url].

In this course, award-winning tech innovator and AI/ML leader Kesha Williams guides you through several concepts and techniques that you can use to fine-tune LLMs using your own data. Explore the concepts and costs of fine-tuning and learn how to set up your environment for it. Go over the steps to prepare your data and fine-tune a pre-trained LLM. Plus, practice evaluating and iterating a fine-tuned model. Practical, hands-on challenges in each chapter give you a chance to deepen your understanding of the topics.

_See the readme file in the main branch for updated instructions and information._
## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
